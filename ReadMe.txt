Professor, since we did the project using RMarkdown, the codes and text comments in the rmarkdown was also copied to the appendix. However, it looks messy. So instead, we are attaching 3 PDF files:

1) Statistical-Modelling - Final Report: Entire report based on project guidelines, but messy appendix
2) Statistical Modelling - Final Report (Report Only)
3) Statistical-Modelling - Final Report (Appendix Only): This one was knitted directly from RStudio so this is readable already

Other files:
4) StudentPerformanceFactors: dataset
5) Statistical Modelling - Final Project (Full Report): RMarkdown document for script and text notes
